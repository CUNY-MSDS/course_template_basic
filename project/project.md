Project
================

The purpose of the data project is for you to conduct a reproducible
analysis with a data set of your choosing. There are two components to
the project, the proposal, which will be graded on a pass/fail basis,
and the final report. The outline for each of these are provided in the
templates. When submitting the assignments, include the R Markdown file
(change the name to include your last name, for example
`Bryer-Proposal.Rmd` and `Bryer-Project.Rmd`) along with any
supplementary files necessary to run the R Markdown file (e.g. data
files, screenshots, etc.). Suggestions for possible data sources are
included below, however you are free to use data not listed below. The
only requirement is that you are allowed to share the data. Projects
will be shared with others on this website so should be presented in a
way that other students can reproduce your analysis.

| Introduction         | The research question is clearly stated, can be answered by the data, and the context of the problem clearly explained.                     | The research question is unclear and/or not supported by the data.                                                                  | Research question is ambiguous, unclear, or not stated.                                                      |
| Data Display         | Includes appropriate, well-labeled, accurate displays (graphs and tables) of the data.                                                      | Includes appropriate, accurate displays of the data.                                                                                | Includes appropriate but no accurate displays of the data.                                                   |
| Data Analysis        | The appropriate statistical test(s) was used for the data and interpretation was clear.                                                     | The appropriate statistical test(s) was used but interpretation was not fully clear or well articulated.                            | The incorrect statistical test was used an/or not justified for the data as presented.                       |
| Conclusion           | Conclusion includes a clear answer to the statistical question that is consistent with the data analysis and the method of data collection. | Conclusion includes an answer to the statistical question that is consistent with the data but not with the data collection method. | Conclusion does not include an answer to the statistical question that is consistent with the data analysis. |
| Overall Presentation | Attractive, well-organized, well-written presentation                                                                                       | Presentation has two of the three qualities: attractive, well-organized, well-written.                                              | Presentation is not attractive, organized, or written.
